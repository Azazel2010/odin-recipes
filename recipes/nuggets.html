                <li> 2 large eggs </li>
                <li> 2 tablespoons almond milk (or milk of choice) </li>
                <li> 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into into 1 inch cubes </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Preparation</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Add panko breadcrumbs to a large baking sheet and spread out in an even layer. Spray breadcrumbs with nonstick olive oil cooking spray. Bake for 2 minutes, then stir breadcrumbs (or just give the pan a shake) and then bake for 2-3 minutes or until breadcrumbs are golden brown. Keep heat in the oven.</li>
                <li>Transfer breadcrumbs to a medium bowl. Whisk in spices: salt, black pepper, onion powder, paprika, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and almond milk. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Line the large baking sheet with an oven safe wire metal rack. Spray with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Dip each chicken cube into the egg mixture, then use a tong to grab each chicken nugget and toss into the breadcrumb mixture to completely coat with breadcrumbs. Use tongs to transfer to the wire rack, placing about 1 inch apart.</li>
                <li>Generously spray the tops of the chicken nuggets with nonstick spray. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes until cooked through and temp reaches 165 degrees F with a meat thermometer. Serves 4. Serve with BBQ sauce, honey mustard, ketchup or whatever sauce you’d like!</li>
            </ol>
